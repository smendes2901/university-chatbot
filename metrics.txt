What is the pre requisite of the course CS 559?
The prerequisite for the course CS 559 Machine Learning: Fundamentals and Applications is either (MA 222 and MA 232) or CS 556, and the student must be a Graduate Student or have a standing of Junior or Senior.

What is the course CS 513 about?
CS 513, Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, is a course that introduces fundamental and practical tools, techniques, and algorithms for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KD&DM). It provides a balanced approach between methods and practice, covering techniques for transforming corporate data into business intelligence, including online Analytical Processing (OLAP) Systems, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Rule-Based Systems (RBS), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Machine Learning (ML), Classification Trees (C4.5 Algorithm), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART Algorithm). The course also includes case studies from real-world applications to demonstrate the application of these techniques to real-world problems. The course is worth 3 credits and is typically offered in both the Fall and Spring semesters. It is available to graduate students or those who are at least juniors in their undergraduate studies. The course is part of the Computer Science Program.

What is the course CS 559 about and how many credits is it worth?
Based on the provided context, someone interested in finance and marketing can take the following courses at Stevens Institute of Technology:
FIN 684 Financial Services Industry Marketing and Sales - This course focuses on selling and marketing IT strategies in the financial services industry, covering topics such as the "sell-side," the "buy-side," the selling distribution process, e-business selling strategies, marketing strategies, corporate branding, data warehousing, sales data mining, and client partnerships.

Can I, an MS in Machine Learning student take the course BIA-613 as my core subject?
No, as an MS in Machine Learning student, you cannot take BIA-613 as a core subject. BIA-613 is not listed under the Machine Learning Core Requirements or Machine Learning Core Electives Requirements for the MS in Machine Learning program. However, you may be able to take it as a general elective, as the program allows for 3 general electives which can be any graduate course.
Course Number	Course Name	Credits	Can be taken as Core Subject?
BIA-613	Not Listed	Not Listed	No
Please consult with your academic advisor to confirm if you can include BIA-613 as a general elective in your study plan.

If an MS in machine learning student takes the course CPE-695 will it count as one of their core electives?
Course Number	Course Name	Credits	Counts as Core Elective
CPE 695	Applied Machine Learning	3	Yes

What courses should I take in my first and second semester in Masters in Machine Learning?
I don't know the specific courses you should take in your first and second semester in the Masters in Machine Learning program at Stevens Institute of Technology. However, you should consult the program's curriculum and your academic advisor to determine the required and elective courses for your degree. If you are an international student and depending on your English proficiency test scores, you may also need to take English Language Communication (ELC) courses such as ELC 071, ELC 081, or ELC 091.

       "['Students with pending or approved H-1B petitions are permitted to extend their F-1 OPT/STEM OPT work authorization from the end of the OPT/STEM OPT period through September 30. This period, known as the Cap-Gap, only applies to those whose OPT/STEM OPT period ends prior to September 30 and to those with H-1B petitions filed with a request for a change in immigration status, not consular processing. This regulation enables those on OPT/STEM OPT to continue their employment until their H-1B takes effect on October 1.\\nPlease note that ISSS is unable to advise students on H-1B specific related matters, and students should always consult with an immigration attorney for any inquiries they might have regarding their H-1B status or their change to H-1B status. ISSS is unable to provide updates to students regarding the H-1B or Cap-Gap information on their SEVIS Records. Student\\'s employers or immigration attorneys will always have the most up to date and accurate information surrounding a student\\'s H-1B petition.\\nNote: Students working for institutions of higher education or their affiliated or related nonprofit entities, non-profit, or government research organizations are exempt from the H-1B cap and no Cap-Gap is issued.\\nStudents are eligible for H-1B Cap-Gap if: \\nthe employer files an H-1B petition as a \"Change of Status (COS),\" not \"Consular Notification,\" with USCIS.\\nthe current OPT/STEM OPT period ends prior to September 30.\\nthe student is on authorized OPT/STEM OPT on the date that USCIS receives the H-1B petition.\\nStudents who have approved OPT/STEM OPT work authorization beyond October 1 are not eligible for Cap-Gap.\\nNote: If your H-1B petition is filed during the 60-day grace period following your OPT/STEM OPT work authorization, you are not eligible for the Cap-Gap extension of employment. You may still be eligible to remain in the U.S. while your application is pending before beginning to work again on October 1, if approved. Please consult your immigration attorney for more information about this scenario.\\nIf the H-1B petition was filed via Change of Status (COS), the change to H-1B status will be automatic from the start date on the I-797 Approval Notice and the student\\'s F-1 Student Records will be automatically marked \"Completed\" in SEVIS. If the student is eligible for the Cap-Gap extension, it will be automatically applied to the student\\'s work authorization.\\nIf the H-1B petition was filed via Consular Processing, the student will need to exit the United States and complete the H-1B visa process at the consulate indicated on the I-797 notice. The student\\'s F-1 Student Records will remain \"Active\" until the student returns to the United States in H-1B Status.\\nStudents whose H-1B petitions were processed via Consular Processing are not eligible for the Cap-Gap Extension. Students approved for Consular Processing should contact \\n[email protected]\\n when they enter the U.S. in H-1B status for the first time.\\nAlthough the Cap-Gap extension of OPT/STEM OPT is automatic if the student is eligible, the student will need to apply for an updated I-20 indicating that the OPT/STEM OPT work authorization has been extended through September 30. Please note that students will need to have a pending or approved H-1B petition in order to receive a Cap-Gap I-20. Being selected in the lottery is not the same as a pending or approved H-1B petition and the lottery selection does not trigger a Cap-Gap extension.\\nStudents can apply for the Cap-Gap I-20 by submitting the Cap-Gap Extension I-20 Application and the I-797 Receipt or Approval Notice in the \\nISSS Student Portal.\\n \\nThe status for dependents of F-1 students with Cap-Gap Extension will automatically have their status extended as well. If applying for the Cap-Gap I-20, an updated I-20 for the F-2 dependents will also be issued. \\nPlease remember that the ISSS processing time for all requests is 10 business days.\\nPlease note that there is no Employment Authorization Document (EAD) issued for Cap-Gap. The Form I-20 serves as evidence of Cap-Gap work authorization.\\nAs the Cap-Gap period is an extension of the OPT/STEM OPT Period, the student must continue to maintain their F-1 visa status until the end of the Cap-Gap extension period. This includes: \\ncontinuing to submit \\n6-month STEM Reports\\n for those on STEM Extension\\ncontinuing to abide by the allotment of unemployment days while on OPT or STEM OPT\\ncontinuing to update ISSS of any changes to employment or biographical information within 10 days of the change\\nIf the H-1B petition is not approved by the end of the Cap-Gap Extension period, the student is not authorized to work beyond September 30, unless they have other approved work authorization. Please reach out to your immigration attorney for additional information.\\nIf the student was authorized for Cap-Gap Extension while on Post-Completion OPT and is eligible to apply for OPT STEM Extension, it is recommended that the student apply for the STEM OPT Extension. If your H-1B application is denied but you have applied and been approved for the STEM OPT extension, you will be able to continue working using your F-1 status. USCIS must receive the OPT STEM Extension application prior to the end date of the Cap-Gap Extension, September 30. \\nAny questions related to traveling during the Cap-Gap period should be discussed with your immigration attorney. You can also find out more information related to travel and the Cap-Gap period on the \\nStudy in the States website\\n.\\nThe Cap-Gap Extension period will come to an end on September 30 as the H-1B status will go into effect on October 1. In order to close the student\\'s F-1 Student Record, the student should submit their H-1B Approval Notice in their \\nISSS Student Portal\\n using the SEVIS Record Closure Request. \\nStudents on STEM OPT Extension (even if STEM OPT was recently approved during the Cap-Gap Extension period) should submit their entire Form I-983 with a completed Final Evaluation (bottom half of page 5) in their \\nISSS Student Portal\\n along with their I-797 Approval Notice using the SEVIS Record Closure Request. \\nIf the H-1B petition is withdrawn, revoked, or denied, the Cap-Gap extension ends and is no longer valid for employment. \\nStudents whose H-1B petitions have been withdrawn, revoked, or denied, for any reason other than a status violation are allotted the standard 60-day grace period from the date of the rejection notice to either exit the United States, transfer to a new U.S. institution, apply for the change of degree level, or apply for a new change of status.\\nStudy in the States\\n - H-1B Status and the Cap-Gap Extension\\nUSCIS\\n - F-1 Status and Cap-Gap Regulations\\n(c) \\n2024\\n Stevens Institute of Technology',\n",

       " 'F-1 students have two options for off-campus employment other than CPT or OPT. These other options require authorization, a new I-20 from ISSS, and also require approval and an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from USCIS. Except in rare circumstances, off-campus employment is not available until a student has completed one academic year (one fall and one spring semester) in full-time study in F-1 status within the U.S. The below information provides more specific information in regard to each type of off-campus employment authorization, severe economic hardship employment and employment with an international organization.\\nFor both of these off-campus employment opportunities, your F-1 reporting responsibilities remain the same. You are still required to report the following information to ISSS within 10 days of making the change:\\nChange of name: Providing your updated passport noting the change.\\nChange of address: In addition to reporting this to ISSS, it is particularly important that changes of address be \\nreported immediately to USCIS\\n if your application is still pending with USCIS so that your documents (Receipt, Approval Notice, EAD, etc.) will be sent to you at the correct address.\\n \\nWHAT IS IT?\\nSevere Economic Hardship Employment is off-campus employment authorization for students who are experiencing serious financial difficulties caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond their control that occurred after they applied for and received the F-1 visa or I-20 (for students who changed status in the U.S.).  If authorized, you may get any kind of legal employment anywhere in the U.S. and work a maximum of 20 hours per week while school is in session (fall and spring semesters) and full-time during vacation periods.\\nHOW CAN YOU QUALIFY FOR IT?\\nYou must have been in F-1 status for one academic year.\\nOn-campus employment has been either unavailable or insufficient to meet your needs\\nYou must be able to provide EVIDENCE which proves that you have financial problems that are caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond your control.  Any reasons are acceptable as long as you can convince USCIS that they could not have been avoided and are beyond your control.\\nExamples of unexpected expenses may be: unexpected medical expenses, illness or death of a sponsor or a sponsor\\'s family member, a sponsor\\'s business problems, natural disasters or other problems where your sponsor lives, currency devaluations, or large tuition increases.\\nIf your financial difficulties are caused by problems your sponsor is having (the person who provided you with the financial support to receive your Form I-20), that person should provide evidence of the unexpected circumstances that are now affecting your support and complete a Revised Affidavit of Financial Support indicating the new amount that will be provided (if any) and evidence of continued financial capability to provide it.  Evidence may include newspaper/journal/web articles, official school notices, medical bills, death notice, etc.   \\nHOW DO YOU APPLY?\\nIf you think that you qualify for Severe Economic Hardship Employment authorization but would like to discuss the process further, \\nemail an ISSS advisor\\n to discuss your situation.\\nOnce you submit the required documentation and we believe that you have a reasonable case, we will recommend that USCIS authorize your employment due to severe economic hardship, issue you a new I-20, and you will send your application to USCIS to process your work authorization.\\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?\\nAfter you send your application to USCIS, plan that it will take \\nabout three months\\n for your EAD (Employment Authorization Document) to be returned to us from USCIS.\\nSometimes USCIS will write asking for more evidence of your financial problems. If you receive a Request for Evidence, please let us know; this may delay your application processing.\\nHOW LONG WILL I BE ABLE TO WORK?\\nUSCIS grants hardship employment authorization for one-year periods.

However, if you wish to get an updated I-20 showing your STEM OPT approval, you can request a reprint I-20 (reason: updated) from your \\nISSS Student Portal\\n Control Center. \\nContact \\n[email protected]\\n if you receive any other notice, such a Request for Evidence (RFE), from USCIS. \\nBelow you will find webpages for the STEM OPT Filing Checklist, Frequently Asked Questions, and How to Maintain your F-1 Status while on active STEM OPT. \\nUSCIS now allows STEM OPT Extension applications to be filed online. You have the option to submit your application via regular mail or file online. This webpage will guide you through the application requirement for your STEM OPT Application to USCIS. \\nUsing the online I-765 to apply for STEM OPT Extension.\\nMany of the questions you may have about requesting, filing for, or participating in STEM OPT can be answered on our Frequently Asked Questions Page. \\nOnce you are on active STEM OPT, you must follow the STEM OPT Employment and Reporting requirements to maintain your F-1 Status.\\nIf you have received your EAD card and find that there is an error on the card, such as a name misspelling, birth date error, or the wrong OPT Category was issued, or if you have lost your EAD Card, please refer to the information on this webpage to request a new EAD Card from USCIS. \\n(c) \\n2024\\n Stevens Institute of Technology',\n",
       " \"Off Campus work, such as CPT or OPT, will require ISSS and/or USCIS Authorization \\nbefore\\n you may begin working. \\nIf you work before the authorized start date  or you work without proper work authorization, your F-1 status will be\\n \\nterminated.\\nCurricular Practical Training (CPT) is work authorization that is granted to eligible F-1 students so that they may complete the requirements of a course or the Cooperative (Co-Op) Education Program.\\nOPT is off-campus employment authorization that allows F-1 students to gain work experience in the major/field of study in which they are currently studying.\\nYou may use OPT during (pre-completion) or after (post-completion) your studies.\\nThe maximum amount of work you are permitted is 12 months of full-time employment for each higher educational level you pursue in the U.S.\\nIf you work part-time (less than 20 hours per week) before graduation (pre-completion OPT), your work time accrues at  1/2 rate (for instance, if you work part-time for six months, you've only used three months of your OPT).\\nCertain majors in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields also qualify for a 24-month extension of OPT after completing their post-completion OPT. Please refer to the \\nSTEM OPT page\\n for more information.\\nF-1 students participating in post-completion OPT who have earned or are currently earning a bachelor's, master's, or Ph.D. from a qualified degree program on the \\ngovernment STEM-designated list\\n, may be eligible to apply for the 24-month STEM Optional Practical Training (OPT) extension.\\nStudents with pending or approved H-1B petitions are permitted to extend their F-1 OPT/STEM OPT work authorization from the end of the OPT/STEM OPT period through September 30. This period, known as the Cap-Gap, only applies to those whose OPT/STEM OPT period ends prior to September 30 and to those with H-1B petitions filed with a request for a change in immigration status, not consular processing. This regulation enables those on OPT/STEM OPT to continue their employment until their H-1B takes effect on October 1.\\nF-1 students have two options for off-campus employment other than CPT or OPT. These other options require authorization, a new I-20 from ISSS, and also require approval and an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from USCIS. Except in rare circumstances, off-campus employment is not available until a student has completed one academic year (one fall and one spring semester) in full-time study in F-1 status within the U.S. The below information provides more specific information in regard to each type of off-campus employment authorization, severe economic hardship employment and employment with an international organization.\\n(c) \\n2024\\n Stevens Institute of Technology\"]"

Any reasons are acceptable as long as you can convince USCIS that they could not have been avoided and are beyond your control.\\nExamples of unexpected expenses may be: unexpected medical expenses, illness or death of a sponsor or a sponsor\\'s family member, a sponsor\\'s business problems, natural disasters or other problems where your sponsor lives, currency devaluations, or large tuition increases.\\nIf your financial difficulties are caused by problems your sponsor is having (the person who provided you with the financial support to receive your Form I-20), that person should provide evidence of the unexpected circumstances that are now affecting your support and complete a Revised Affidavit of Financial Support indicating the new amount that will be provided (if any) and evidence of continued financial capability to provide it.  Evidence may include newspaper/journal/web articles, official school notices, medical bills, death notice, etc.   \\nHOW DO YOU APPLY?\\nIf you think that you qualify for Severe Economic Hardship Employment authorization but would like to discuss the process further, \\nemail an ISSS advisor\\n to discuss your situation.\\nOnce you submit the required documentation and we believe that you have a reasonable case, we will recommend that USCIS authorize your employment due to severe economic hardship, issue you a new I-20, and you will send your application to USCIS to process your work authorization.\\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?\\nAfter you send your application to USCIS, plan that it will take \\nabout three months\\n for your EAD (Employment Authorization Document) to be returned to us from USCIS.\\nSometimes USCIS will write asking for more evidence of your financial problems.
